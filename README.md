# ðŸ‘‹ Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

### Just kinda exploring things

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently trying to explore frontend & backend
  - Sometime i try to learn vanilla js, frontend website component like nabar,footer, card etc kinda web components and sometimes i try to explore (no practical coding :)!!) reactjs, polymer, angular, SPA, reactnative etc and how they work
  - Sometimes i try to learn how backend servers work, like how firewall work, how Proxy works how WAF, Reverse Proxy, Load Balancers, Forward Proxy, Secure web Gateway works etc

## âš¡ Fun facts About Me: 
  - i do not understand styling in web pages, whatever looks good i try to add it
  - i hate adding tooo much classes for particular tag, better to have less html :||
  - like React because the way it reuses and uses the component modal, i mean dividing the code into function [backend kind of stuff in frontend]
