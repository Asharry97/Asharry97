# 👋 Hello Everyone 👋

## Just kinda Exploring(🔭) things

  - I’m currently trying to explore frontend & backend
  - Sometime i try to learn vanilla js, frontend website component like nabar,footer, card etc kinda web components and sometimes i try to explore (no practical coding :)!!) reactjs, polymer, angular, SPA, reactnative etc and how they work
  - Sometimes i try to learn how backend servers work, like how firewall work, how Proxy works how WAF, Reverse Proxy, Load Balancers, Forward Proxy, Secure web Gateway works etc

## ⚡ Fun facts: 
  - i do not understand styling in web pages (i am trying to understand it, working on it), whatever looks good i try to add it.
  - I have learnt few things like flex box and responsive web design kindof a beginner++
  - i hate adding tooo much classes for particular tag, better to have less html :||
  - like React because the way it reuses and uses the component modal, i mean dividing the code into function [backend kind of stuff in frontend]
