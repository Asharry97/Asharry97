### ðŸ‘‹ Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently trying to explore frontend & backend
  - Sometime i try to learn reactjs react native how they
  - sometimes i try ot learn how backend servers work, how firewall work
- âš¡ Fun fact: 
  - i do not understand styling in web pages, 
  - whatever looks good i try to add it
  - i hate adding tooo much classes for particular tag, better to have less html 
  - like React because the way it reuses and uses the component modal, i mean dividing the code into function [backend kind of stuff in frontend]
